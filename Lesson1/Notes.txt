- look at existing Unity3D code
- talk about improvements, e.g. not keeping original messing around code like GameObject.FindObjectOfType<...>() cluttered all over the code
  - Use properties to clean up
  - Move things around so we don't need to call other code so many times
  - Use proper classes and inheritance
  - Code inspectors and test frameworks help: Visual Studio, ReSharper, NCrunch, NDepend, NCode, many more
  - Pathfinder rule: Always leave code better than you found it
